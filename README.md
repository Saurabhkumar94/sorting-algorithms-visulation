 # “Sorting Algorithms Visualizer (Java Swing + AWT)”

Create a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer in Java using Swing + AWT (or optional JavaFX/Processing for smooth animation).

The goal is to build a modular, responsive, and  visualization platform demonstrating how sorting algorithms operate, analyze, and optimize data sequences in real time.

# ⚙️ 1. Core Algorithms [Keyboard Key → Algorithm]

Key	Algorithm	Description

B	Bubble Sort: Simple comparison-based swap sort

I	Insertion Sort	Incremental element placement

S	Selection Sort	Repeated minimum extraction

M	Merge Sort	Divide-and-conquer sorting

Q	Quick Sort	Partition-based sorting

H	Heap Sort	Binary heap sorting

# All algorithms should be derived from an abstract SortingAlgorithm class with hooks for visualization updates.

🎛 2. GUI Requirements

Use an MVC Architecture with these modules:

core/ → App launcher & control logic

algorithms/ → All sorting algorithms (each as a separate class)

gui/ → Panels for visualization, control, metrics, and overlays

input/ → Keyboard + mouse manager

theme/ → Light/Dark color themes + customization

Main GUI Components:

Control Panel:

Buttons → Start, Pause, Reset, Randomize, Step-by-Step

ComboBox → Algorithm selector

Sliders → Sorting speed, Array size

Toggle → Light/Dark mode

Canvas Panel:

Double-buffered rendering for smooth animation

Color-coded bars with transitions and shadows

FPS display + runtime metrics

Status Panel:

Algorithm name

Comparisons, swaps, and recursion depth

Execution time (ms)

# 3. Keyboard Shortcuts (UX Layer)

B	🫧 Bubble Sort
I	🔑 Insertion Sort
S	🧮 Selection Sort
M	⚙️ Merge Sort
Q	⚡ Quick Sort
H	🏗 Heap Sort
Ctrl + P	📊 Show performance chart
Ctrl + H	❔ Show help/shortcut overlay
Esc	⏹ Emergency stop current sorting
# 4. Technical Features

✅ Multi-threading & Thread-safe rendering

Use a dedicated animation thread per algorithm.

Apply SwingUtilities.invokeLater() for safe UI refresh.

Implement a pause/resume lock mechanism using ReentrantLock.

✅ Dynamic Data Management

Generate random, reverse-sorted, or nearly-sorted arrays.

Option to import data from CSV for real-world analysis.

✅ Performance Analysis Mode

Compare algorithms side-by-side visually.

Record time taken, swaps, comparisons → auto-plot in a bar chart (using JFreeChart or custom renderer).

✅ Step-by-Step Debugging Mode

Single-step forward/backward per iteration.

Highlight key indices (i, j, pivot, etc.) visually.

✅ Adaptive Visualization

Auto-scale bar width & height with window size.

Use gradient colors and animations for comparison/swap highlights.

Add smooth transitions using linear interpolation for better visuals.

✅ Theme + Customization System

Separate class for managing themes (ThemeManager.java)

Support for Light/Dark + Custom RGB themes

Store user preferences in a config.json file

✅ Statistics Overlay (Floating HUD)

# Display:

Algorithm Name

Comparisons / Swaps counter

Elapsed time

Array size

Current speed

Semi-transparent overlay using AlphaComposite.

# 5. Architecture Expectations

Use OOP + Design Patterns:

Abstract Class → SortingAlgorithm

Strategy Pattern → Dynamic algorithm switching

Observer Pattern → GUI updates

Singleton → Theme manager / Settings

MVC → Separation of logic, data, and rendering

# 6. Code Quality 

Full Javadoc comments

Proper package structure

Exception handling for thread interruptions

Consistent naming (camelCase, PascalCase for classes)

Logging support (java.util.logging)

Modular, reusable methods

Documented with UML or Class Diagram

# 7. Optional  Features

🧬 AI Mode: Automatically choose the most efficient algorithm based on data pattern detection.

📦 Plugin System: Allow users to add their own sorting algorithms dynamically.

📈 Real-time Graph: Display time complexity curve as array sorts.

🔊 Audio Feedback: Generate tones for swaps/comparisons.

🧠 Learning Mode: Step-by-step explanation text beside animation.

🌐 Web Export: Generate a GIF or video of sorting visualization.

# PROJECT ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

The project follows MVC (Model–View–Controller) style separation —
where the frontend (View + Controller) handles the GUI, and the backend (Model) handles sorting logic & data.

# FRONTEND (GUI / User Interaction Layer)

* Purpose:
Everything that the user sees, clicks, or interacts with — including buttons, sliders, animations, and the main display area.

📁 Files & Packages:

# File / Class	Description
Main.java	Launches the GUI; sets up the main window (JFrame).

VisualizerPanel.java	handles all graphics rendering — draws bars, highlights comparisons/swaps, and smooth animation.

ControlPanel.java	contains UI controls (buttons, dropdowns, sliders) and listens for user actions.

ThemeManager.java	Controls light/dark color schemes for UI.

InfoPanel.java (optional)	Displays algorithm name, time complexity, swaps/comparisons.

KeyboardManager.java	Handles keyboard shortcuts (space, Ctrl+R, etc.)

OverlayPanel.java (optional)	Displays overlays like pause messages or performance charts.

 # 🖼️ Frontend Technologies:

Java Swing + AWT

Custom rendering with Graphics / Graphics2D

Event Handling via ActionListener, KeyListener

Thread-safe UI updates with SwingUtilities.invokeLater()

Smooth animation using double buffering & Threads

# 🧠 BACKEND (Logic / Data Processing Layer)

# Purpose:
Implements all the sorting logic, algorithm behaviors, and data updates that drive the animation.

📁 Files & Packages:

File / Class	Description
SortingAlgorithm.java	Abstract base class or interface — defines methods like sort(int[] array) and visualizeStep().
BubbleSort.java: Implements Bubble Sort logic.
InsertionSort.java: Implements Insertion Sort logic.
SelectionSort.java	implements Selection Sort logic.
MergeSort.java	Implements Merge Sort logic.
QuickSort.java	implements Quick Sort logic.
HeapSort.java	implements Heap Sort logic.
ArrayGenerator.java	Creates random / reverse / nearly-sorted arrays.
MetricsTracker.java	Tracks swaps, comparisons, and elapsed time.
SortManager.java	Controls which algorithm runs, manages threads, and coordinates GUI updates.

# 🧮 Backend Technologies:

Java multithreading (Thread, SwingWorker)

OOP abstraction & inheritance

Data metrics collection (comparisons, swaps)

Timing with System.nanoTime() or System.currentTimeMillis()

Algorithm switching via Strategy Pattern

# 🔗 FRONTEND ↔ BACKEND CONNECTION

User selects algorithm & speed in ControlPanel.

SortManager instantiates the corresponding SortingAlgorithm (e.g., new QuickSort()).

Sorting runs in a background thread.

Each swap/comparison triggers a call to VisualizerPanel.repaint().

VisualizerPanel redraws updated bars smoothly.

InfoPanel updates stats in real-time.
